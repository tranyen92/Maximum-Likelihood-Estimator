# Maximum-Likelihood-Estimator
Likelihood function from a Poisson distribution. Plot the function for a range of appropriate possible values of λ. Find the value of λ for the sample given that maximized the likelihood.

The number of particles emitted by a radioactive source during a ten second interval has the Poisson distribution with mean λ. The radioactive source is observed over twenty non- overlapping intervals of ten seconds each. The number of particles emitted during each interval are: 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 5.
